# Student-Mental-Health-Analysis
Analysis of a survey conducted by a Japanese University in 2018 on if attending a university in a foreign country can impact one's mental well being. 
I used MS SQL server to do a thorough analysis of the survey results and reached a conclusion on how the length of time stayed in a foreign country can severly impact a student's mental health.
